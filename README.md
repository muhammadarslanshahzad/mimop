# MiMoMop

**Your new cleaning buddy with attitude**

MiMoMop is not your boring vacuum. It’s a tiny, autonomous robot that can:

* Move around your room like a boss
* Clean floors and surfaces
* Pick up stuff lying around
* Talk to you (funny, sarcastic, or cute vibes)

Instead of silent chores, it turns cleaning into a game 🎮 with XP, challenges, achievements, and personalities. You can switch MiMoMop from **Sarcastic Janitor** to **Cute & Clumsy** anytime.

## Project Description

Cleaning is boring. Robots are usually boring too. MiMoMop changes that. It mixes **robotics + AI + humor + gamification** to make cleaning fun and interactive. It remembers your habits, adapts its humor, and gently nudges you to keep your space tidy while doing all the work itself. Think of it as a tiny, opinionated roommate that never complains but always keeps your space clean.
